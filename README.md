# button-mapper

A simple vibe code godot project made for R36XX with arkOs and 640x480 screen in mind. Meant to be unzipped on r36xx via ssh terminal, if unzip on windows may require fixing permissions. Still need testing.
It shows me how godot maps buttons and analogs of my device in format "DEVICE 0 BUTTON [num] PRESSED"
On pc it works with a connected gamepad. Not sure if works with multiple gamepads.
